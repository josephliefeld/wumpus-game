# wumpus-game
Was an assignment for Intro to Computer Science at OSU. 
Main goals for the assignment were to become familiar with creating "Is-a" relationships using Inhertitance using virtual functions, 
implementing Polymorphism, and overall practice Object-Oriented Programming.

Assignment Description:

  Hunt the Wumpus is a game set inside the cave of the Wumpus, a scary, gold-hoarding monster
  who likes to eat people who disturb its sleep. The player's goal is to guide an adventurer to
  either kill the Wumpus, or find its hidden gold and escape alive. The Wumpus lives in a large
  cave of rooms arranged in a grid, where each room has four tunnels leading to the rooms to the
  north, east, south, and west.
  The adventurer starts the game in a random empty room in the Wumpus’ cave. Their starting
  position is also the location of the escape rope that they must use to escape after they’ve
  completed their task.
  Each room may be empty, or it may contain one (and only one) of four "events" (all described
  below): two kinds of dangerous hazards, the terrifying Wumpus, and the gold treasure. When
  the adventurer is in a room that’s adjacent to one containing an "event", the player will receive a
  percept (a message) to inform them about the event the adventurer is close to.
  The player wins the game if they can safely guide the adventurer through the cave to either a)
  kill the Wumpus, or b) pick up the gold and make it back to the escape rope unharmed!

Personal Takeaways:

  Was a very daunting assignment that was difficult to complete in the time given, a large part due
  to the massive scale of the assignment. Even though they are parts of the assignment that didn't 
  work as intended, I still managed to receive a 86/100 when I demoed the code with my instructor, 
  and overall the program served as a great insight into how some games function, and was a good 
  introduction into OOP as a whole.
